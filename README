This layer provides the below frameworks of AliOS Things Linux Edition.

uMESH
------------

uMesh is a wireless mesh network stack implementation with following features:
    - RF standards independent, currently 802.11/802.15.4/BLE are supported, and more can be supported
    - Routing mesh, support Tree Topology, Mesh Topology and Layered Tree&Mesh Topology
    - Self-healing, no single point of failures
    - Low Power Mode
    - EAP(Extensible Authentication Protocol) with ID2
    - Seamless IPv4/IPv6 integration providing Socket programming environment
For details, please refer to https://github.com/alibaba/AliOS-Things/wiki/AliOS--Things-Networking-Overview#umesh-network

The recipe umesh provides the libmesh.a and related header files, you can develop your
application based on the mesh library. The recipe umesh also provides a test program mesh_test, you can use
it to test the mesh library.

uOTA
------------

An over-the-air update is the wireless delivery of new software or data to smart devices,
especially IoT devices. Wireless carriers and OEMs typically use over-the-air (OTA) updates
to deploy the new operating systems and the software app to these devices.

The recipe uota provides the libOTA.a, libLK.a and related header files, you can develop your OTA
application based on the OTA library. The recipe uota also provides an example program OTA_APP,
you can use it for a quickly experience on our uOTA.
