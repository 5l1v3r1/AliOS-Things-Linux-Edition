Subject: [PATCH] Fix the world build failure due to the missing rule of
 generating shim.key

Upstream-Status: Pending

shim.key is not given without feature/mok-secure-boot, the script
make-certs already integrated in shim is able to generate it and shim.crt
for signing. However, the commit 79c0d3ab3964ff03483277a515aaf50016bbe786
forgets to add the rule of generating shim.key, causing the world build
failure.
