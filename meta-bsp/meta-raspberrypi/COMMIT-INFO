    userland: RPROVIDES is missing libegl
    
    userland package is the Raspberry Pi provider for the openGL stack.
    If selected, it shall provide the gles2 and egl stacks in conjunction
    with mesa-gl.
    
    libegl was missing in the RPROVIDES variable, thus some run-time
    dependencies were not met when using userland as provider.
